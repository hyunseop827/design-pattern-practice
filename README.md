# Design Patterns (Java)

### A simple repository to **learn and practice design patterns** using **Java**.

- Organized by pattern (one module per folder)
- Small, readable examples that are easy to revisit later
- Includes a refactoring practice module (`99practice`) using design patterns on AI-generated code
- Written with **Java 21**, but most code should also work on older Java versions
- To practice and learn about design patterns.
- Each module has a few packages, you can easily find the codes.
- Some of `README.md` are written by AI.
