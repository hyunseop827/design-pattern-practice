# Design Patterns (Java)

This repository is for learning and practicing **design patterns** using **Java**.

- Each module focuses on one design pattern and contains small example code.
- The `99practice` module is for refactoring practice: code generated by an AI was improved by applying design patterns.
- Written with **Java 21**, but most code should also work on older Java versions.

## Repository Structure

Modules are separated by folder, and the folder name starts with an index number

### 01strategy
Practice examples for the **Strategy** pattern (swap behaviors by replacing strategies).

### 02command
Practice examples for the **Command** pattern (wrap actions into command objects).

### 03composite
Practice examples for the **Composite** pattern (treat a group and a single object in the same way).

### 04singleton
Practice examples for the **Singleton** pattern (ensure only one instance exists).

### 05decorator
Practice examples for the **Decorator** pattern (add features without modifying the original class).

### 06template-method
Practice examples for the **Template Method** pattern (fixed algorithm flow with overridable steps).

### 07observer
Practice examples for the **Observer** pattern (subscribe/notify event relationships).

### 08factory-method
Practice examples for the **Factory Method** pattern (create objects through a factory method).

### 09abstract-factory
Practice examples for the **Abstract Factory** pattern (create related objects as a family).

### 10adapter
Practice examples for the **Adapter** pattern (connect incompatible interfaces).

### 99practice
Refactoring practice module.
- Contains code that was originally generated by an AI.
- Refactored by applying design patterns.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended).
3. Pick a module and run the example `main` class (if included).

## Notes
- This repository will be updated continuously while studying.
- The goal is to keep examples small and easy to review later.
