# Refactoring Practice

This module contains code that was originally generated by AI, then refactored and improved by applying design patterns.

## Purpose
- Practice identifying code smells
- Apply appropriate design patterns to improve code
- Compare before/after implementations

## Examples
- `ex1` - Payment processor refactored with **Strategy** pattern
- `ex6` - File data source refactored with **Decorator** pattern

## Structure
Each example contains:
- `before/` - Original code with issues (OCP violation, tight coupling, etc.)
- `after/` - Refactored code applying design patterns
